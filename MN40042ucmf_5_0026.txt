LANGUAGE AND sanan

Suetonius oi necessity refleets the literary tendencies oi
his time, yet his style is less typical of the Silver Age than
that of any other writer of the period. His use ot Greek
words and poetical phrases and constructione seems to be>
due to the influence of the age rather than to his personal
inclination. He airus at clearness‚ simplicity, aud brevity,
though on occasions condensation is attaiued at the expense
ol'clearness. The brevity ol Suetonius’ diction is not epi-
grammatic, uor employed with evideut artistic purpose. It
is the brevity of economy, which airus to express the thought
in the simplest and fewest words. N eglect ot concinnity and
parallelisrn of construction, while not carried to excess as in
Tacitus, are peculiarities ot Suetonius' style. The sentences
are comparatively short, and there is an entire absence oi
the periodio structure. As would be expected from these
tmits, his prose is not harrncnious. Iu fact, he seems to be
utterly lacking in a feeling for rhythrn. 'He does not strive
for effect, and his diction is singularly free from rhetorical
ornamentation. He keeps himself entirely out of his works,
with the result that his style is scmewhat colorless. Its
very simplicity, however, gives an elemeut of strength aud
vigor. The following are the most notioeable linguistic
characteristics :
