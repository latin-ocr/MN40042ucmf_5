20. Actium manumittere: this is probably the case ¹referred to
by Dio, lvii. 11, where he states that Tiberius was so fair and y'ust
that when 1110 people demanded the manumIssion 01 an actor, he

, would not permit it until the owner had signified his willingness and
had received his price.

22. nisi 1011111111 . . . probassent: Tacitus, Aua. i. 75, attributes
this conduct on the part 01 Tiberius to his love 01 severity, which he

¹ displayed even in meritorious actions. Velleius' explanation (11129)
is more favorable. He implies that the senate was asked to pass upon
such casesin the interest oi frugality and economy.

. mariied and raised a family.

peius tlte sura os 100‚000,000 sesterces without iuterest; es. Dio,
lviii. 21. Roth's text reads sestertio, a conjecture 01 Glareanus
101· sestertium 01 the manuscripts. Iu view 01 the lact that almost
without exception the manuscripts 01 Suetonius read sestertium in
passages where the numeral adverb is used, and where the sum
expressed is in the genitive and ablativo (passages in Roth always
amended to sestertii and sestertio), it seems much safer to regard '
the nunreral as an indeclinable substantive and sestertium as genitive
plurals 111 the present passage proposito milies is ablative absolute.
It must be acknowledged, however, that the forms sestertio and
sestertii do occur in such constructions with manuscript authority,
especially in Tacitus. The two constructions probably existed side
hystrie. See Hcruurd Studies iu Classical Plrilotopy, Vol. VH,
p. 210 seq.

29. quibusdam dominis, ete. .· Tacitus, Aua. iv. 64 (21 aa), tells

how the people murmured and said that Tiberius had formed the plan
¹ to be absent, knowiug it to be a year hoding disaster. Their corn-
plaints were silenced by his generosity. On the occasion 01 a severe
fire ten years later, Tiberius again came to the assistance 01 hispeople.
This is passed over in silence by Suetonius. A corps 01 uigiles had
been formed 111 the year 6 an, one 01 whose duties was to protect
