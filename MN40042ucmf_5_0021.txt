que most of the writers ol the Silver Age, Gaius Suetonius
Tranquillus is exoeedingly reticent as to his early lite. He
states, however, that his father, Suetonius Laetus,l a military
tribune, took part iu the battle of Bedriacum?
whioh wes fought in the year 69 Ab. To this
meagre information with regard to his family,
Suetonius' contemporaries add nothing. Not even the place
of his birth is mentioned. Vossius, a Dutoh scholar of the
seventeenth century, suggests³ that he was a native oi
isalpine Gaul, but adduces nothing more oonvinoing to
upport this theory than the feet that Suetonius’ friend,
'liny the Younger, was e native oi that region. The year
uf his birth, while quite uncertain, oannot be assigned to a
later 'date than 75 A.D., as may be inferred from a passage
ited luter, in whioh he speaks oi a pseudo-Nero at the court
ri Vologeses.

Α few personat references relating to the period of his
y outh are found in his writings. For example,
n his lite oi Caligula, after stating the gener-
e ly aoeepted theory that the emperor hed built⁴ his bridge
