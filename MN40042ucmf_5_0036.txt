11. περὶ ἐπισήμων πορνῶν, an aoeount or those oonrtesans
who had become renowned throughtheirwit, beauty, or genius.

12. De Vittls corporalibus, e list of bodily defeets, written
possibly to supplement the medioal works ol Celsus and
Scribonius Largus. =

13. De Institutione officiorum, a mannulos rank as fixed
hy lawand ol soeial and eonrt etiqnette.

rt. De Renibus, in three books, eontaining biographies of
the rnost renowned monorohs in eaoh ol the three divisions
of the world, Europe, Asia, and Atrida.

15. De Rebus Vurlts. Of this there are few and insignifi-
oant notioes.

16. Prota, miseellanies, in ten or perhaps twelre books.
This was a very populor work, and it is probable, as Reiffer-
seheid supposes, that many of the foregoing treatises were
merely portions of the praesuntsed under separate names.
The Proto was extensirely used by later writers, especially
Isidore, through 'whom the parts on natural history beeanre
well known during the Middle Ages.

Of all these works, there hore survived only parts of the De
Viris illustribus, and the Lloes of tle Odeson-s, that is, ot Nos. 9
and 10 of the above list. The De Viris illustribus treated of
those eminent in literature, and comprised treatises on poets,
orators, historiens, philosophers, grammarians, and rhetori-
eians. First same a list oi the authors treated, then followed
the earlier history oi the department in question, and finally
the prineipal representatives were discussed in chronological
order. The series ot orators began with Oieer03 of histo
rians, with.Sallust. The lives ol Tacitus and Pliny the
Younger were not treated, for this work, like the Lines of
tle Onasus, did not extend beyond the time ol Domitian.

Or the earlier parts of the' work, there are extant excerpts
rnade by Diomedes and J erome. Frons the book De Poetis,
we possess the lires ot Terence, Horaee, and that ot Lnean.
