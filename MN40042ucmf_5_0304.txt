8. Iudaeos impulsore Chresto, etc: 101 the expulsion ottho
Jews by Tiberius, see note on p. 22. l. The tumultsrelerred to were
probably due to contentione between the Jews and Christiane, ior'the
Romans regarded the latter simply as asect 01 1111 former. By the
name chrestus, Suetonius probably refers to Christ, who irom the Ro-
man point 01 view rnight well be the one who caused the disturbances.
The Romans 1111 nothing but contempt 101 the Jews, and it 111011-
ceivable that Suetonius, though hebed heard 01 Christ, was not aware
that he had been executed in the reign 01 Tiberius and that he-lrad
never been at Rome. Both Tertullian, Apol. 3, aud Lactantius, In-
stit. iv. 7. 5, testity that the Romans, in their ignoratum, used the forms
0111111111 and Obrcsticni. Dio, 116, states that Claudius, finding the
number oi Jews at Rome so great that they could nothe expelled
without causing tumults, simply torbade those who observed the
J ewish rites meeting together. Dio probably refers 10 the Christiana
