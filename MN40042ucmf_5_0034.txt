XX INTRODUCTION. ΙΙΙ,

’ o. Tamquam and precisi are sometimes used, as in Tacitus,
introducing a subjunctive clause where the accusative with
infinitivo nright have been expected:

tenetque optrito tarracona et natas rot sit, Aac. ὃς increbrescente
ruptore otiosi . . ..corarrrororetru·‚ Tib. 11.

d. Er with the force of etiora is very common.

e. Quo is used to introduce a clause ot' purpose where no
comparison is involved: ¹

oco. . . subduceret, Tib. 22. ’

f. Donec is used with the subjunctive in a statement of
fact.

Viewed as awhole, the Latin ot Suetonius is not so closely
modelled on the Ciceronian style as that ol Quintilian or
that ol Pliny the Younger, nor does 'rt exhibit such marked
peculiarities ot the Silver Age as do the diction ot Seneca
aud Tacitus: It does not present many difficulties, and is
admirably adopted to the purpose of its author.

THE WORKS OF SUETONIUS,

Some of the worlrs of Suetonius were written in Greek,
others in Latin, a practice followed by many ol the authors
of the time. Δ

With the exception of the Lines of tbe orteia-s, but few
fragments considering the burk ot his productione, have
come down to ns, and considerable doubt ,exists even in
regard to the titles of many ol the works. ,

The first collection ot the fragnrents¹ was made by Isaac

1The standard edition ol the fragments is Reiffersclreid's, which
may he consulted tor further information with reference to them.
