Tun Lines of the Odessos contained in this collection are
ol great interest to* the student ol Roman history, since
theytreat of the perlod covered hythe Accola of Tacitus,
by which they are so admirably illustrated and the gaps
of which they serre to bridge. The Lines are, too, in
special need of elucidation, partly because of their author's
disregard of chronological sequence and partly because of
their extreme conciseness. The N otes oi this edition, there-
fore, have been made rather full, with a view to confirm,
refute, or further illustrate the statements of Suetonius
by citations froin other authors, especially from Tacitus,
Dio Cassius, and the latter's abridger, Xiphilin.

No commentary on the Liyes of this edition has, sofar
as Ι arn auare, been published in any modern language.
The old commentators, and the Baumgarten-Orusius-Hase
edition in particular, haye been of assistance in preparing
the Notes, but or necessity, inan edition ol this kind, much
of the work has been done independently. The text adopted
is that ol Roth (1857), with modificatione

Ι wish to express rny great indebtedness to Professor
Oharles E. Bennett and Professor John O. Rolle for their
many raiuable suggestions. Ialso appreciate‘the assistance
given me by rny colleague, Dr. John'E. Granrud, who read
critically the proof'of the commentary.
